# Jordan Peterson ASCII Art (Python)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates Python fundamentals by creating an ASCII-style portrait of Jordan Peterson using loops, conditional statements, and logical thinking.

## Objective
- Practice nested loops
- Use conditional statements
- Improve logical reasoning using coordinates
- Create visual output using basic Python

## Concepts Used
- for loops
- if-elif-else conditions
- print() function
- logical operators

## How the Code Works
The console is treated as a 2D grid (rows and columns).  
Each position is checked using conditions to decide which character to print:
- @ for face boundary
- O for eyes
- | for nose
- - for mouth

## How to Run
```bash
python ascii_jordan.py
